"""Bundesagentur für Arbeit (German federal employment agency) scraper.

Single largest open job source we cover: ~1M+ active postings across
every German employer that lists with the agency. The portal at
``arbeitsagentur.de`` exposes a public unauthenticated JSON API that
the official frontend consumes:

    GET https://rest.arbeitsagentur.de/jobboerse/jobsuche-service/pc/v6/jobs
        ?size=100&page={1..100}
    Header: X-API-Key: jobboerse-jobsuche

The official frontend moved listings from v4 to v6 in August 2026. The v6
response uses ``ergebnisliste`` and renamed German field keys, while job
details remain on the v4 endpoint.

The API caps pagination at ``size × page = 10,000`` results per query
(``size=100, page=100``). Past that limit, the server returns 400.

To collect the full ~1M jobs we subdivide *recursively* using only facets
whose bucket counts form an exact, non-overlapping partition of the current
query. If the API exposes no such partition for an oversized leaf, we build
an overlapping cover from every official sort order plus high-cardinality
facets, deduplicate by reference number, and accept it only when its unique
row count reaches the API's advertised total. Otherwise the scrape fails
closed and preserves the previous complete dataset.

The earlier version subdivided by Bundesland names, but the API's
``arbeitsort`` filter expects *city* names (e.g. ``"Berlin"``,
``"München"``), not states (``"Bayern"`` returns 0) — that bug capped
output at ~301k.

Single-tenant scraper: ``company_slug`` is informational and ignored.
The output rows carry the German employer name as ``company`` so the
publisher's cross-ATS dedup still works.
